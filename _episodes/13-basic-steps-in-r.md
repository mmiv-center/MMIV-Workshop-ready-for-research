# Module 1: Reproducible Science

## Merge two data dictionaries

R has some convenient tools to merge tables. A table in R is called a data frame and contains columns of different types. Some of the usual types are numbers, dates, or categorical (factor) variables such as "YES", "NO". R will attempt to guess the type of a column based on the values. If for example a single entry in a column is a string like "NA" the whole column will be interpreted as a categorical column.

Lets start by downloading two test spreadsheets in csv format that contain cortical brain volumes for an imaginary study. Both spreadsheets have been generated by independent workflows on the same image data and we would like to merge them into a single spreadsheet.
