# Module 1: Table data

## Merge two data dictionaries

R has some convenient tools to merge tables. A table in R is called a data frame and contains columns of different types. Some of the usual types are numbers, dates, or categorical (factor) variables such as "YES", "NO". R will attempt to guess the type of a column based on the values. If for example a single entry in a column is a string like "NA" the whole column will be interpreted as a categorical column.

Lets start by downloading two test spreadsheets in csv format that contain cortical brain volumes for an imaginary study. Both spreadsheets have been generated by independent workflows on the same image data and we would like to merge them into a single spreadsheet.

~~~
git clone https://github.com/mmiv-center/MMIV-Workshop-ready-for-research.git rfr
cp rfr/data/d1.csv .
cp rfr/data/d2.csv .
\rm -R rfr
~~~

After these steps the current directory should contain two spreadsheet files that we want to read into R, merge and export again as a new spreadsheet.

### Read spreadsheet

Start R - or RStudio in the directory that contains the two spreadsheets d1.csv and d2.csv.
~~~
d1 = read.csv('d1.csv')
d2 = read.csv('d2.csv')
head(d1)
  PatientID PatientName  StudyDate Vol_Hippocampus Vol_Amygdala

### Merge the two spreadsheets

In order to merge the spreadsheets we need to identify one or more columns that can be used to match the data from table d1 to table d2.
~~~
dall = merge(d1, d2, by.x=c("PatientID", "PatientName", "StudyDate"), by.y=c("ID", "Name", "StudyDate"), all.x=T, all.y=T)
~~~

### Save the result again

~~~
write.csv(dall, file="dall.csv", row.names=F)
~~~


## Table 1

One of the first steps in a project is to describe your raw data. In R we can use the 'tableone' package.

~~~
install.packages('tableone')
install.packages('stargazer')
library('tableone')
library('stargazer')
varList = c("Vol_Hippocampus", "Vol_Amygdala", "intra_cranial_volume", "Vol_Amygdala_l", "Sex")
table1 = CreateTableOne(vars = varList, data = dall)
stargazer(print(table1))
~~~
